** I. ABOUT *************************************************************

ZooKeeper is an all-in-one IRC bot for Gazelle servers. It manages users,
allows Gazelle to give feedback in IRC, and allows your bash/sh scripts
to have IRC feedback capabilities too. ZooKeeper is written in python 
using threading and MySQL libraries.

*************************************************************************
** II. FEATURES *********************************************************

- Traditional Gazelle IRC server '/msg bot enter CHAN USER KEY' commands
  but ZooKeeper can handle '/msg bot enter CHAN,CHAN2,CHAN3 USER KEY'

- Automatically set the IRC username of the user that executes the 'enter'
  command to that of their username in Gazelle. Do the same for the user's
  host using the format USERNAME.USERCLASS.SITENAME

- !user USERNAME: View basic stats of a user or yourself (yourself if no 
  USERNAME val)

- /msg bot enable USERNAME : Allows IRC operators to enable a user on the
  site right from IRC (UNFINISHED!)

- A listening socket that forwards all data to the IRC server though
  ZooKeeper. This is used to make Gazelle and bash/sh scripts communicate
  with the IRC server.

- Automatically SAJOIN IRC operators to all channels when they join
  the AdminChannel.

- Convert HTTP site URLs to HTTPS sit URLs and vice-versa.

- Automatically give HalfOp, Voice or ChanOp status to staff when they 
  join any channel.

- Kick non-staff from the staff channel

- Added a Staff list clone called HighStaff for High-Level staff members
  Only HighStaff can join the admin channel and run certain commands

- Staff can enable a user on the Gazelle site through the bot. Useful for
  help channel. USAGE: /msg ZooKeeper ENABLE [username]

- Works with password protected channels.

*************************************************************************
** III. INSTALLING ******************************************************

ZooKeeper depends on the following packages to run:
  - python
  - python-mysqldb
  - netcat (for bash/sh script integration)

There is really no installation procedure for ZooKeeper other than just
copying the ZooKeeper directory to where you want it and then running:
'chmod +x ZOOKEEPER_DIR/zookeeper.py' to make the scripts executable. 
You will need to edit zookeeper.conf before you run the bot. I run 
ZooKeeper in a screen like this (so I can see the debug output):
  screen -S zookeeper ZOOKEEPER_DIR/zookeeper.py
To close the screen terminal without killing ZooKeeper, press Ctrl+a+d.
To go back to that screen terminal, run:
  screen -R zookeeper

NOTE: This is what the Oper tags line looks like for UnrealIRCd, these
are the privs needed for ZooKeeper to work correctly!!

** IV. MODS *************************************************************

--> mod_Greeting:
mod_Greeting is a modification for ZooKeeper that checks if a user has
an IRCGreeting when they join a channel, if they do, ZooKeeper send the
greeting as a public message in that channel.
You need to specify the DB table and field where the IRC greeting is kept
for each user. For example, I use this in table 'users_info':
  `IRCGreeting` mediumtext NOT NULL DEFAULT 'NONE'
It is pretty simple to write some code to make the greeting editable from
the user.php page.
I created this mod as another perk to give out to higher donors on my 
site. Yes, it would get annoying after a while, but it is harder to obtain
than a custom title.

--> mod_OnIRC:
mod_OnIRC is a modification for ZooKeeper that watches for users to JOIN,
PART, or QUIT the UserWatchChan and then updates a table in the Gazelle
database with their current IRC online status. If they JOIN, it adds a
record, PART or QUIT, it deletes the record.
This could be used for IRC bonuses or an 'IRC Status' box on users profile
pages.
To use this mod, you have to add the following to your Gazelle MySQL db:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `irc_online_users` (
  `ID` int(15) NOT NULL,
  `Username` varchar(75) NOT NULL,
  `Nickname` varchar(75) NOT NULL,
  `Joined` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  KEY `ID` (`ID`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;

--> mod_IRCPrivs
mod_IRCPrivs is a modification for ZooKeeper that sets IRC privileges for
users when they join any IRC channel that ZooKeeper is sitting in. This
mod requires that this field be in the users_info DB table:
  `IRCPrivs` ENUM( '0', '1', '2', '3' ) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'
The acceptable values for IRCPrivs are: '3', '2', '1', '0'
Oper = 3, HolfOp = 2, Voice = 1, None = 0

If mod_IRCPrivs is disabled, ZooKeeper will use the config file to
determine the IRC privileges for a user.
I will gladly help you out with the user.php and takemoderate.php code
for this Mod. Find me in #gazelle or irc.copythatfloppy.org #zookepper
NOTE: Read the included file 'install_module_frontends.txt' I am still
working on making it easier to do, but these rough instructions should
get you started.

--> mod_StaffAssistAlerts
This module will alert staff members via IRC PM and in the future, eMail.
If a user enters the !help command in either the help, invites or disabled
channels, staff will be alterted. Only HighStaff are alerted for the disabled
channel. To prevent users from spamming staff and flooding them with PMs, a
user can only execute the !help command 3 times every 24 hours. Please note
that the original !help command is still the same as it was before when 
executed in other channels.

There is one setting that goes along with this module. mod_SAA_AlertLevel
determines how staff is contacted by the bot. "1" = IRC PM, "2" = IRCPM and eMail.
eMail is not operational yet and will be finished in the near future.
